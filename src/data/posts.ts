And I knew, I felt that this was not the end. That she's out there somewhere, hiding and laughing at me. She is my daughter. I still remember her last look. Nightmare. There was everything in this look: pain, fear, misunderstanding.",

She replies that I am not in a position to joke. The next time I was about to joke, for some reason I couldn't. Apparently it was a very funny joke. I never joked about it again.",
